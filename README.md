# AMLend2end
AML End to End Example

## Project description
This project demonstrates end to end pipeline how to train binary anti money laundering (AML) classifier based on 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Graph embeddings. Proposed solution includes following sub sections:  

Data ingestion - We will use sample of transactions data generated by [AMLSim](https://github.com/IBM/AMLSim) 
Feature store – We use Hopsworks Feature Store to compute features, organize them as feature groups and store for 
downstream analysis, such as creating training datasets for model training, as well as retrieving them      
Graph Embeddings - We will use [stellargraph](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph) library to compute graph 
embeddings.
 
 
Streaming predictions – Lastly, we make fraud predictions on a stream of transactions, using AWS Lambda to pull aggregate features from the online feature store. We use the latest feature data to calculate transaction ratios and then call the fraud detection endpoint.

## Notebooks description


#### transaction_feature_engineering_ingestion.ipynb
Create 1 features group from the AMLSim project https://github.com/IBM/AMLSim .
The feature group represents the generated transactions. 
The features are transformed in numerical.

#### training_dataset_for_embeddings.ipynb
Create 2 training datasets for accounts and transactions.
