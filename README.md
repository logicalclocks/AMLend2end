# AML End to End Example

## Project description
This project demonstrates end to end pipeline how to train binary anti money laundering (AML) classifier based on 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Graph embeddings. Proposed solution includes following sub sections:  

* Data ingestion - We will use sample of transactions data generated by [AMLSim](https://github.com/IBM/AMLSim) 
* Feature store â€“ We use Hopsworks Feature Store to compute features, organize them as feature groups and store for 
downstream analysis, such as creating training datasets for model training, as well as retrieving them      
* Graph Embeddings - We will use [StellarGraph](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph) library to compute graph 
embeddings.
* Anomaly detection model - We will use keras implementation of [adversarial anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11034.pdf) 
* that was adapted to tabular data.
* Hyper parameter tuning - We will use [Maggy](https://github.com/logicalclocks/maggy) to conduct experiments for hyperparameter tuning.  
* Model serving - We will use Hopsworks model server to predict anomalous transaction.
